# Schelling's Model

This is a [Shelling's model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schelling%27s_model_of_segregation) that I completed for a course. Here the world is implemented as fixed 10*10 torid world. If desired one could easily change this to work with modular arithmetic to work with worlds of any size. 


__Scenarios created in the provided notebook:__

* Scenario 1: Every home has to have at least 4 or more neighbors that are the same as them.

* Scenario 2: Every home has to have between 1 and 4 (inclusive) neigbors that are the same as them.

* Scenario 3: The third scenario adds a third neighbor that likes BOTH winter and summer sports. These neighbors are sufficent for both summer sport neighbors and winter sport neihbors. In this scenario we still make sure every home has at least 4 like minded neighbors.
